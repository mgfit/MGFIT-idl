This sub-directory contains IDL procedures from external libraries which are required for use by the MGFIT IDL library.

These procedures are included in the MGFIT package unchanged and solely for the purpose of making it self contained. 
In this way, it removes the 'burden' of installation of additional libraries from the end user.

The respective copyrights, restrictions and disclaimers of the original libraries apply for these procedures.
